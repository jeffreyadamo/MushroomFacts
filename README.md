## Description

~~~
	USER STORY:
		○ AS A USER of mushroom website
		○ I WANT TO be able to search by mushroom name (Genus Species)
		○ SO THAT I receive data about that specific mushroom
~~~

Initial goals of this project:  
~~~
	• Utilize ReactJS framework to utilize fast DOM updates (good responsiveness)
		○ Practice building React.js app deployment
		○ MySQL rdms
		  §  KnexJS/ObjectionJS vs SequelizeJS?
		○ Heroku server hosting
			§ How large can these open-source databases hold before they charge?
				□ Data-specific or traffic-specific?
					® Don't envision large traffic, but datasets can be larger with this set
	• Node.js
		○ I don't know python
	• Express.js
	• DTO with JSON
	
	• Learn how large of datasets I can utilize
		○ I'm used to 100-1000s of entries to query, not 100k
		○ How does local performance take a hit
			§ May need to utilize indexing in database sets
			
	• Performance goal: lazy loading
	• Stretch goal: Test Driven Development
